# Character Development

Creating compelling, dimensional characters.

## Core Character Elements

Every protagonist needs:

| Element | Question | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Want** | What do they pursue? | Win the competition |
| **Need** | What must they learn? | Self-worth isn't external validation |
| **Lie** | What false belief holds them back? | "I'm only valuable if I win" |
| **Ghost** | What past event created the Lie? | Father only praised achievements |
| **Flaw** | How does the Lie manifest? | Sabotages relationships for success |

**Want vs. Need**: Want is external (plot goal); Need is internal (character arc). Story satisfies when character gets Need, whether or not they get Want.

## Character Arc Types

### Positive Arc (Change)
Character overcomes Lie, achieves Need, transformed for better.
- Setup: Character believes Lie
- Confrontation: Lie is challenged repeatedly
- Resolution: Character rejects Lie, embraces Truth

### Negative Arc (Fall)
Character succumbs to Lie, fails to change, ends worse.
- **Disillusionment**: Discovers terrible truth, loses hope
- **Fall**: Rejects Truth for Lie, becomes what they fought
- **Corruption**: Already damaged, spreads damage to others

### Flat Arc (Steadfast)
Character already knows Truth, changes the world around them.
- Character holds Truth against world's Lie
- World/other characters transform
- Character tested but remains constant

## Deep POV

Intimate third person that feels like first person without "I."

### Techniques

**Remove filter words:**
- ❌ She saw the door open.
- ✅ The door swung open.

**Remove thought tags:**
- ❌ She thought he was lying.
- ✅ He was lying. Had to be.

**Use character's vocabulary:**
- ❌ She observed the deteriorating infrastructure.
- ✅ The place was falling apart.

**Embed emotion in perception:**
- ❌ She felt angry when she saw the mess.
- ✅ The mess covered every surface. Typical.

**Free indirect discourse:**
Character's thoughts without quotation marks or tags, blending narration and interiority.
> Where had he gone? She'd told him to wait. Told him specifically. And now this.

### Deep POV Checklist

- [ ] No filter words (saw, heard, felt, thought, wondered, realized)
- [ ] No author intrusion (the narrator knows nothing POV character doesn't)
- [ ] Character's voice in narration, not author's
- [ ] Emotions shown through physical sensation and perception
- [ ] Reactions appropriate to character's knowledge

## Character Voice

Each character should have distinct:

| Element | Questions |
|---------|-----------|
| **Vocabulary** | Education level? Profession? Region? |
| **Syntax** | Short sentences or complex? Fragments? |
| **Rhythm** | Clipped? Flowing? Interrupted? |
| **Topics** | What do they notice? What do they ignore? |
| **Metaphors** | What domain do they draw comparisons from? |

### Voice Differentiation Test

Cover character names in dialogue. Can you tell who's speaking? If not, voices are too similar.

## Revealing Character

**Show, don't tell hierarchy:**

1. **Action under pressure** (strongest): What they DO when it costs them
2. **Dialogue**: What they say (and don't say)
3. **Thought**: Interior monologue (Deep POV makes this seamless)
4. **Appearance**: Physical description (weakest, most static)

**The choice test**: Character is only revealed when they CHOOSE. Forced actions don't count.

## Character Relationships

**Relationship dynamics:**
- What does each want from the other?
- What does each fear about the other?
- What's the power balance?
- What's the source of conflict?
- What history informs their interactions?

**Character contrast**: Pair characters who:
- Want the same thing (competition)
- Want opposite things (opposition)
- Have opposite approaches (methodology conflict)
- Mirror each other (foil relationship)

## Secondary Character Economy

**Major secondary characters**: Own arc, own want/need, significant page time
**Minor secondary characters**: Single defining trait, serve specific story function
**Background characters**: No development needed, functional only

**Roles secondary characters play:**
- Mentor: Teaches, guides, often dies
- Ally: Supports protagonist, provides skills protagonist lacks
- Antagonist: Opposes protagonist's goal (not necessarily villain)
- Love interest: Emotional stakes, often carries B-story
- Foil: Contrasts protagonist, highlights traits by difference
- Catalyst: Causes change without changing themselves

## Character Anti-Patterns

- **Mary Sue/Gary Stu**: Too perfect, no real flaws or failures
- **Informed traits**: We're told they're smart but never see it
- **Motivation vacuum**: Actions without clear reasons
- **Static protagonist**: No arc, no change, just reacts
- **Villain without motivation**: Evil for evil's sake
- **Supporting cast clones**: All secondary characters sound/feel the same
