# Anti-Patterns

Common fiction writing mistakes and how to fix them.

## Opening Mistakes

| Problem | Why It's Bad | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Waking up** | Cliché, passive, slow | Start with character in action |
| **Mirror description** | Cliché, stops story | Reveal appearance through story |
| **Weather report** | Delays character/conflict | Lead with character, weave setting |
| **Dream sequence** | Reader feels cheated | If dream matters, signal clearly |
| **Backstory dump** | Stops forward momentum | Weave in, reveal on need-to-know |
| **"Little did she know..."** | Author intrusion, tells future | Stay in moment, let story unfold |
| **Prologue as info dump** | Boring, skippable | Cut or make it dramatic scene |

## Character Mistakes

| Problem | Signs | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| **Mary Sue/Gary Stu** | Too perfect, no real flaws, everyone loves them | Real flaws with consequences |
| **Informed attributes** | Told "she's smart" but never shown | Demonstrate through choices |
| **Talking heads** | Characters are interchangeable voices | Distinct voice, vocabulary, patterns |
| **Motivation vacuum** | Actions without reasons | Clear want, clear why |
| **Reactive protagonist** | Things happen TO them | Character makes choices that drive plot |
| **Instant expertise** | Character suddenly knows everything | Earn skills through story |
| **Villain monologue** | Bad guy explains entire plan | Show through action, imply motivation |

## Plot Mistakes

| Problem | Why It's Bad | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Deus ex machina** | Unearned resolution | Solution from established elements |
| **Coincidence solves problem** | Feels cheap | Coincidence can start problems, not solve them |
| **Sagging middle** | Nothing happens | Clear scene goals, escalating stakes |
| **Episodic plotting** | "And then... and then..." | "Because of X, Y happened" |
| **Predictable plot** | Reader guesses everything | Subvert expectations (while honoring setup) |
| **Stakes not clear** | Reader doesn't care | What's lost if protagonist fails? |
| **Rushed ending** | Climax then done | Give reader landing time |

## Dialogue Mistakes

| Problem | Example | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **On the nose** | Characters say exactly what they mean | Add subtext |
| **As you know, Bob** | "As you know, your father died in 1995..." | Find natural way to reveal |
| **Said bookisms** | "she ejaculated," "he opined" | Use "said," let dialogue do work |
| **Adverb tags** | "said angrily," "whispered softly" | Action beats or stronger dialogue |
| **Everyone sounds same** | Remove names, can't tell who's talking | Distinct voice per character |
| **Small talk** | "Hello." "How are you?" "Fine." | Enter late, cut to conflict |
| **Speech as exposition** | Characters explain for reader's benefit | Natural dialogue, other reveal methods |

## Prose Mistakes

| Problem | Why It's Bad | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Purple prose** | Overwritten, self-conscious | Clear, invisible prose |
| **Beige prose** | Flat, no voice | Add rhythm, stronger verbs |
| **Filter words** | "She saw... She felt... She heard..." | Direct perception |
| **Telling emotions** | "She was angry" | Show through action, physiology |
| **Adverb overload** | Modifying weak verbs | Stronger verbs, cut adverbs |
| **Repetitive sentence structure** | Same pattern every sentence | Vary length and structure |
| **Head hopping** | POV shifts mid-scene | Commit to one POV per scene |

## Structure Mistakes

| Problem | Why It's Bad | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Starting too early** | Throat-clearing before story | Start as close to conflict as possible |
| **Info dumping** | Stops story cold | Weave in, need-to-know basis |
| **Unearned emotion** | Big moments feel flat | Plant and build |
| **Chekhov's unfired gun** | Setup without payoff | Either pay off or cut setup |
| **Subplot tangent** | Subplot disconnects from main story | Subplot must echo/complicate main theme |
| **Act 2 problems** | Meandering middle | Clear midpoint shift, escalating obstacles |

## POV Mistakes

| Problem | Why It's Bad | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Author intrusion** | Narrator knows more than character | Stay in POV limits |
| **Impossible knowledge** | Character knows things they can't | Only perceive what they could |
| **Head hopping** | Confuses reader, breaks intimacy | One POV per scene minimum |
| **Inconsistent distance** | Deep then distant randomly | Intentional distance control |
| **Wrong POV for story** | First person for plot-heavy, etc. | Choose POV that serves story |

## Pacing Mistakes

| Problem | Signs | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| **Too slow** | Reader skimming, boredom | Cut description, add conflict |
| **Too fast** | Emotions land flat, confusion | Add reaction time, sensory detail |
| **Even pacing** | No dynamics, monotonous | Vary scene/sequel ratio |
| **Wrong moments expanded** | Minor events get pages | Expand important, compress mundane |

## Revision Mistakes

| Problem | Looks Like | Fix |
|---------|------------|-----|
| **Polishing too early** | Beautiful prose, broken structure | Structure first, then polish |
| **Not enough revision** | First draft = final draft | Multiple passes, fresh eyes |
| **Over-revision** | Different not better, reintroducing cuts | Set deadline, ship it |
| **Ignoring all feedback** | Every reader is wrong | Patterns across readers = real problem |
| **Taking all feedback** | Rewrite for every opinion | Your story, your vision, use judgment |

## The "Why" Test

For every scene, every character, every line, ask: **Why?**

- Why does this scene exist? (Advance plot, reveal character, build world)
- Why does this character act this way? (Motivation)
- Why is this detail here? (Setting, character, theme)
- Why would the reader care? (Stakes, emotion)

If you can't answer, reconsider.

## Quick Reference: Red Flags

When something feels wrong, check:

1. Is protagonist making choices, or just reacting?
2. Is conflict present and real?
3. Are stakes clear and meaningful?
4. Is every scene doing work?
5. Is exposition woven or dumped?
6. Do characters have distinct voices?
7. Is pacing appropriate to content?
8. Are setup and payoff balanced?
9. Is the ending earned?
10. Would you keep reading?
