# Revision and Editing

Process for improving drafts.

## Draft Stages

### First Draft (Discovery)
- Get story down
- Don't self-edit while writing
- Embrace mess
- Focus: What happens?

### Second Draft (Structure)
- Fix plot holes
- Restructure scenes
- Cut/add scenes as needed
- Focus: Does it work?

### Third Draft (Character/Theme)
- Deepen character arcs
- Clarify theme
- Strengthen motivation
- Focus: Does it mean something?

### Polish Draft (Prose)
- Line editing
- Sentence rhythm
- Word choice
- Focus: Does it read well?

### Final Draft (Proofread)
- Typos, grammar
- Consistency
- Formatting
- Focus: Is it clean?

## Revision vs. Editing

| Revision | Editing |
|----------|---------|
| Big picture | Line level |
| Structure, plot, character | Sentences, words, clarity |
| Adding/cutting scenes | Polishing existing prose |
| Does this work? | Does this read well? |

**Revise first, edit later.** Don't polish prose you might cut.

## Structural Revision

### Questions to Ask

**Plot:**
- Does every scene advance story?
- Is cause-and-effect clear?
- Are there sagging/rushed sections?
- Do plot turns feel earned?

**Character:**
- Is protagonist's want/need clear?
- Does character change?
- Are motivations believable?
- Is voice consistent?

**Stakes:**
- What's at risk?
- Why should reader care?
- Do stakes escalate?

**Pacing:**
- Where does it drag?
- Where does it rush?
- Are scene/sequel balanced?

### Structural Tools

**Scene cards**: Each scene on card/sticky note. Rearrange physically.

**Outline retroactively**: Write what each scene does. Gaps become obvious.

**The "therefore/but" test**: Scenes should connect with "therefore" or "but," never just "and then."

## Line Editing

### Cut Words That Don't Work

**Filter words**: saw, heard, felt, thought, realized, wondered, noticed, decided
**Weak verbs**: was, were, had, made, got, did
**Unnecessary adverbs**: very, really, just, quite, rather, somewhat
**Filler**: in order to, the fact that, at this point in time

### Strengthen What Remains

- Active voice over passive
- Specific over general
- Strong verbs over adverbs
- Concrete over abstract

### Sentence-Level Checklist

- [ ] Could this be shorter?
- [ ] Is the subject clear?
- [ ] Is there a stronger verb?
- [ ] Does this advance or reveal?
- [ ] Is the rhythm right?

## Self-Editing Techniques

### Distance
- Let draft rest (days/weeks)
- Change font/format
- Print and read on paper
- Read in different location

### Fresh Eyes
- Read aloud (ear catches what eye misses)
- Read backward (sentence by sentence, catches typos)
- Read as reader (not writer)
- Use text-to-speech

### Systematic Passes
1. **Structure pass**: Scene order, plot logic
2. **Character pass**: Arc, voice, consistency
3. **Dialogue pass**: Natural? Purposeful?
4. **Description pass**: Clear? Vivid? Balanced?
5. **Line pass**: Prose quality, word choice
6. **Proofread**: Errors, typos, consistency

## Beta Readers

### When to Use
- After self-revision, before professional edit
- When you can't see problems anymore
- For reader reaction (not craft advice)

### Good Beta Questions
- Where were you bored?
- Where were you confused?
- What did you think would happen?
- Which characters did you like/dislike?
- Would you keep reading?

### Bad Beta Questions
- Is it good?
- What would you change?
- How do I fix it?

## Professional Editing Types

| Type | Focus | When Needed |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Developmental** | Structure, plot, character | After second draft |
| **Line editing** | Prose style, flow | After structure is solid |
| **Copy editing** | Grammar, consistency | After prose is solid |
| **Proofreading** | Typos, final errors | Before publication |

## Revision Anti-Patterns

**Infinite revision**: Never finishing, always tweaking
**Fix**: Set deadline, declare "done"

**Feedback whiplash**: Changing based on every opinion
**Fix**: Wait for patterns across multiple readers

**Polish before structure**: Perfecting sentences in scenes you'll cut
**Fix**: Big picture first, line editing last

**Feedback avoidance**: Not sharing work, revising in isolation
**Fix**: Get eyes on it. You're too close.

**Revision as procrastination**: Revising forever to avoid submission
**Fix**: Recognize the pattern. Ship it.

## When Is It Done?

**Signs you're done:**
- Changes are making it different, not better
- You're reintroducing things you cut
- Trusted readers find no major issues
- It accomplishes what you intended
- You're proud enough to show it

**The 80/20 rule**: Last 20% of improvement takes 80% of time. Know when to stop.
