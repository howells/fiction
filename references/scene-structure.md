# Scene Structure

Micro-level structure for individual scenes.

## Scene vs. Sequel (Dwight Swain)

Every narrative unit alternates between action (Scene) and reaction (Sequel).

### Scene (Action Unit)

**Structure: Goal → Conflict → Disaster**

| Element | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Goal** | What POV character wants NOW | "Get the password from Mark" |
| **Conflict** | Obstacles to goal | Mark refuses, demands something in return |
| **Disaster** | Outcome that creates new problem | Gets password but Mark alerts security |

**Disaster types:**
- **Yes, but...**: Goal achieved, new problem created
- **No, and furthermore...**: Goal failed, situation worsens
- **No**: Simple failure (use sparingly, low tension)
- **Yes**: Success (use rarely, kills tension)

### Sequel (Reaction Unit)

**Structure: Reaction → Dilemma → Decision**

| Element | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Reaction** | Emotional response to disaster | Panic, fear of being caught |
| **Dilemma** | "What do I do now?" | Abort mission or press on? |
| **Decision** | Choice that leads to next scene's goal | Press on, find another way |

### Pacing Through Scene/Sequel Balance

- **Fast pace**: Short sequels, quick reactions, immediate decisions
- **Slow pace**: Long sequels, extended reflection, emotional processing
- **Thriller**: 90% scenes, minimal sequels
- **Literary**: Longer sequels, deep interiority
- **Romance**: Balanced, emotional processing matters

## Motivation-Reaction Units (MRUs)

The building blocks within scenes. Paragraph-by-paragraph structure.

### The Pattern

**Motivation (external)** → **Reaction (internal)**

Motivation: Something happens in the world (objective, observable)
Reaction: Character responds (subjective, internal)

**Always in this order.** The most common mistake is showing reaction before motivation.

### Reaction Sequence

When detailing reactions, follow this order:

1. **Feeling** (involuntary, immediate): Fear, shock, relief
2. **Reflex** (physical, automatic): Jump back, gasp, flinch
3. **Rational action** (chosen): Draw weapon, speak, run
4. **Speech** (deliberate): Dialogue

Not every reaction needs all four. But when present, maintain order.

### MRU Examples

**Bad (reaction before motivation):**
> Sarah screamed. The door burst open.

**Good (motivation then reaction):**
> The door burst open. Sarah screamed.

**Full MRU sequence:**
> The knife flashed toward her face. [Motivation]
> Terror seized her chest. [Feeling]
> She jerked backward, arms flying up. [Reflex]
> Her hand found the lamp on the nightstand and swung it hard. [Action]
> "Get out!" [Speech]

### Using MRUs for Tension

- **Expand MRUs** during high-stakes moments (include all reaction elements)
- **Compress MRUs** during fast action (skip to reflex/action)
- **Slow-motion effect**: Multiple short MRUs in rapid sequence

## Scene Diagnostics

### Scene isn't working? Ask:

1. **Is the goal clear?** Reader should know what character wants within first few paragraphs.
2. **Is there real conflict?** Something must actively oppose the goal.
3. **Does the outcome change something?** No change = no scene.
4. **Can I enter later?** Cut opening until you hit conflict.
5. **Can I leave earlier?** Cut after the disaster lands.

### Red Flags

- **Talking heads**: Dialogue without grounding in action/setting
- **Weather report opening**: Starting with setting instead of character
- **Protagonist as passenger**: Things happen TO character, not because of their choices
- **Information dump**: Scene exists to convey backstory
- **Tea party scenes**: Pleasant conversation with no conflict

## Scene Types

| Type | Purpose | Structure |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Action scene** | External conflict | Heavy on Scene, light Sequel |
| **Emotional scene** | Internal processing | Heavy on Sequel, light Scene |
| **Revelation scene** | New information | Goal: learn X; Disaster: X changes everything |
| **Decision scene** | Character choice | Extended Dilemma, critical Decision |
| **Bridge scene** | Transition | Compressed Scene/Sequel, moves pieces |

## Scene-Level Tension Techniques

- **Ticking clock**: Deadline creates urgency
- **Dramatic irony**: Reader knows what character doesn't
- **Conflicting goals**: Character wants two incompatible things
- **Rising stakes**: Each failure makes success more critical
- **Interruption**: Cut scene at peak tension, resolve later
- **Reversal**: Apparent victory becomes defeat (or vice versa)

## Scene Transitions

**Enter late, leave early.** Cut the boring parts:
- Travel unless something happens during it
- Greetings and small talk
- Characters deciding to go somewhere
- Descriptions of mundane actions

**Transition techniques:**
- **Hard cut**: End scene, start new scene (white space)
- **Bridge sentence**: "Three hours later, she stood at his door."
- **Sequel as transition**: Use reaction/dilemma to move time/space
