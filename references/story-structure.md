# Story Structure

Frameworks for organizing narrative at the macro level.

## Three-Act Structure

The foundational framework most other structures build upon.

| Act | Purpose | Typical Length |
|-----|---------|----------------|
| **Act 1: Setup** | Establish world, character, stakes; ends with inciting incident | ~25% |
| **Act 2: Confrontation** | Rising action, complications, midpoint shift | ~50% |
| **Act 3: Resolution** | Climax, falling action, denouement | ~25% |

**Key beats:**
- **Inciting Incident** (~10%): Disrupts status quo, launches story
- **First Plot Point** (~25%): Point of no return, ends Act 1
- **Midpoint** (~50%): Major revelation or reversal, raises stakes
- **Third Plot Point** (~75%): Dark night of the soul, lowest point
- **Climax** (~90%): Final confrontation, story question answered

## Save the Cat Beat Sheet

Blake Snyder's 15-beat structure, originally for screenwriting but widely adapted.

| Beat | Page % | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| Opening Image | 0-1% | Snapshot of "before" |
| Theme Stated | 5% | What the story is about (often dialogue) |
| Setup | 1-10% | Character's ordinary world |
| Catalyst | 10% | Inciting incident |
| Debate | 10-20% | Resistance to call |
| Break Into Two | 20% | Character commits to journey |
| B Story | 22% | Secondary plot (often love interest/mentor) |
| Fun and Games | 20-50% | Promise of the premise |
| Midpoint | 50% | False victory or false defeat |
| Bad Guys Close In | 50-75% | Pressure intensifies |
| All Is Lost | 75% | Worst moment, whiff of death |
| Dark Night of Soul | 75-80% | Wallowing before revelation |
| Break Into Three | 80% | Solution discovered |
| Finale | 80-99% | Execution of plan, climax |
| Final Image | 99-100% | Snapshot of "after" (mirrors opening) |

## Seven-Point Story Structure

Dan Wells' structure, works backward from climax.

1. **Hook**: Opposite state from Resolution
2. **Plot Turn 1**: Introduce conflict, call to adventure
3. **Pinch Point 1**: Pressure from antagonist, force action
4. **Midpoint**: Character moves from reaction to action
5. **Pinch Point 2**: More pressure, things fall apart
6. **Plot Turn 2**: Final piece of puzzle, power to win
7. **Resolution**: Opposite state from Hook

**Key insight**: Determine your Resolution first, then Hook as its opposite. Build the middle around the Midpoint shift.

## Fichtean Curve

Structure emphasizing continuous rising action through crises.

```
         Crisis 4 (Climax)
            /\
    Crisis 3 /  \
      /\    /    \
Crisis 2/  \  /      \
  /\  /    \/        \
Crisis 1  /           \
    /    /             \
___/____/               \___
Rising Action    Falling Action + Denouement
```

**Characteristics:**
- Begins close to or at first crisis (minimal setup)
- Series of escalating crises
- Each crisis raises stakes higher
- Minimal falling action after climax
- Best for: thrillers, action, tightly-paced stories

## Snowflake Method

Randy Ingermanson's fractal approach to story development.

1. **One sentence**: Story in 15 words or fewer
2. **One paragraph**: Three disasters + ending (5 sentences)
3. **Character summaries**: One page per major character (motivation, goal, conflict, epiphany, one-paragraph summary)
4. **Expand paragraph**: Each sentence becomes a paragraph
5. **Character synopses**: Full page per character
6. **Expand to 4 pages**: Each paragraph becomes a page
7. **Character charts**: Complete character development
8. **Scene list**: Spreadsheet of all scenes
9. **Scene descriptions**: Multi-paragraph per scene
10. **First draft**: Write from scene descriptions

**Best for**: Plotters who need to know the whole story before writing.

## Choosing a Structure

| If you need... | Consider... |
|----------------|-------------|
| Proven commercial framework | Save the Cat |
| Simple backbone | Three-Act |
| Fast pacing | Fichtean Curve |
| Character-driven story | Seven-Point (hook/resolution as character states) |
| Detailed pre-planning | Snowflake Method |
| Literary/experimental | Loose three-act or none |

## Structure Anti-Patterns

- **Sagging middle**: Act 2 meanders. Fix: Strong midpoint reversal, clear scene goals.
- **Rushed ending**: Act 3 too short. Fix: Give climax room to breathe, earn the resolution.
- **Episodic plotting**: Events feel disconnected. Fix: Tighten cause-and-effect chain.
- **Predictable beats**: Reader anticipates every turn. Fix: Subvert expectations while honoring setup.
- **Slavish adherence**: Story feels mechanical. Fix: Use structure as guide, not straitjacket.

## Subplot Integration

Subplots should:
- Mirror, contrast, or complicate main plot theme
- Have their own arc (beginning, middle, end)
- Intersect with main plot at key moments
- Resolve before or just after main climax

Common subplot types:
- **Romance/relationship**: Character's emotional journey
- **Internal conflict**: Character vs. self
- **B-story mentor**: Teaches theme to protagonist
- **Mirror character**: Shows what protagonist could become
