# Prose Style

Sentence-level craft for fiction.

## Show, Don't Tell

The fundamental principle: create experience, don't summarize it.

### The Spectrum

**Pure telling**: Sarah was angry.
**Showing emotion**: Sarah's jaw tightened. Her hands curled into fists.
**Showing through action**: Sarah hurled the vase at the wall.
**Showing through dialogue**: "Get out. Now."

### When Telling is Better

- Transitions and time compression
- Information the reader needs quickly
- Low-stakes moments (not every emotion needs showing)
- Establishing facts efficiently

**Rule of thumb**: Show what matters, tell what doesn't.

### Showing Techniques

| Instead of | Show through |
|------------|--------------|
| Emotion words (angry, sad, happy) | Physical sensation, action, perception |
| Character traits (smart, kind, brave) | Choices and behavior |
| Relationship quality (they were close) | Interaction and history |
| Setting mood (it was creepy) | Concrete sensory details |

## Sentence Rhythm

### Vary Sentence Length

Long sentences create flow, building momentum, allowing ideas to accumulate and carry the reader forward through increasingly complex territory until the thought reaches its natural conclusion. Short sentences punch. They create emphasis. They break rhythm. Use them for impact.

### Sentence Starts

Avoid starting too many sentences with:
- The same word
- Pronoun + verb (He went. He saw. He thought.)
- "There was" / "It was"

### Fragment Use

Fragments work for:
- Emphasis
- Interior thought
- Capturing rhythm of consciousness
- Creating punch

Not in formal narration or every paragraph.

## Strong Verbs

### Verb Power Hierarchy

1. **Active specific**: slammed, crept, lunged
2. **Active general**: went, moved, looked
3. **Being verbs**: was, were, seemed
4. **Passive voice**: was slammed, was being watched

### Verb Selection

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| walked slowly | crept, shuffled, ambled |
| ran fast | sprinted, bolted, tore |
| said loudly | shouted, bellowed, roared |
| looked at | studied, examined, glared at |

**But**: Don't overdo it. "Said" is better than "ejaculated." Normal verbs are invisible; thesaurus-diving is distracting.

## Sensory Details

### Beyond Sight

Most writers default to visual. Engage all senses:
- **Sight**: Shape, color, light, movement
- **Sound**: Volume, pitch, rhythm, silence
- **Touch**: Texture, temperature, pressure, pain
- **Smell**: Often triggers memory (powerful for emotion)
- **Taste**: Underused, intimate

### Selective Detail

**Not this**: She entered a room with blue walls, a wooden desk, three chairs, a lamp on the desk, papers scattered everywhere, a window with white curtains...

**This**: Sunlight cut through dusty air. Papers everywhere—on the desk, the floor, spilling from half-open drawers.

**Principle**: Choose details that reveal character, mood, or plot significance. Skip the inventory.

### The Power of Specific Detail

Generic details create generic fiction. Specific details create life.

| Generic (forgettable) | Specific (memorable) |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| a dog | a three-legged beagle named Chester |
| an old car | a rusted Volvo with a cracked windshield |
| a nice house | a Victorian with a wraparound porch and peeling yellow paint |
| she drank coffee | she wrapped her hands around the chipped mug, the one with "World's Okayest Mom" in faded letters |
| it was cold | ice had formed on the inside of the windows |

**Why specificity works:**
- **Creates the illusion of reality** — Invented but believable details convince readers
- **Implies a larger world** — One specific detail suggests countless unmentioned ones
- **Reveals character** — What someone notices tells us who they are
- **Opens into the universal** — Paradoxically, the more specific, the more relatable

**How to find the right detail:**
1. Ask: What would THIS character notice in THIS moment?
2. Choose details with emotional or thematic resonance
3. Avoid the first detail that comes to mind (it's probably a cliché)
4. Use details that do double duty (setting + character, mood + foreshadowing)

**Warning:** Specificity ≠ exhaustive description. One precise detail beats five generic ones. The goal is evocation, not inventory.

## Point of View Integrity

### POV Violations

**Head-hopping**: Switching POV mid-scene
> Sarah wondered if Mark was lying. Mark hoped she'd believe him. [Two heads]

**Author intrusion**: Narrator knows more than POV character
> Little did she know, the letter would change everything. [Who's saying this?]

**Impossible perception**: Character can't know this
> Her face turned red. [Can't see own face]

### Maintaining POV

Everything filtered through POV character:
- Only perceive what they'd notice
- Use their vocabulary, not author's
- Honor their knowledge limits
- Show their biases in description

## Managing Multiple POVs

For novels with more than one viewpoint character.

### How Many POVs?

| Count | Best For | Risk |
|-------|----------|------|
| 1 | Intimate character study, mystery, thriller | Limited scope |
| 2 | Romance, dual protagonists, conflict from both sides | Must balance page time |
| 3-4 | Epic scope, ensemble cast | Reader attachment dilutes |
| 5+ | Epic fantasy, saga | Very difficult to manage |

**Rule of thumb**: Use the fewest POVs that serve the story. Each added POV costs reader investment.

### Balancing POV Time

- **Primary POV**: Gets 50-70% of page time, reader's anchor
- **Secondary POVs**: Support primary, provide essential information
- **Equal split**: Works for romance, dual protagonists; harder elsewhere

### When to Switch POV

**Switch at**: Chapter breaks (cleanest), scene breaks (section dividers), rarely within scenes

**Switch for**:
- Information POV character can't access
- Dramatic irony (reader knows what protagonist doesn't)
- Showing antagonist's perspective
- Parallel storylines

**Never switch to**:
- Avoid difficult scenes
- Show what could be implied
- Create artificial suspense

### Making Voices Distinct

Each POV character needs distinct:
- **Vocabulary**: Education, profession, region, personality
- **Sentence patterns**: Terse vs. flowing, fragmented vs. complete
- **Observations**: What they notice and ignore
- **Metaphor domain**: A sailor thinks in sea metaphors, a musician in sound

**Voice test**: Can reader identify POV character without being told?

### Structural Patterns

- **Alternating**: A-B-A-B (common in dual POV romance)
- **Rotating**: A-B-C-A-B-C (ensemble cast)
- **Protagonist-heavy**: 80% protagonist, 20% others for specific scenes
- **Escalating**: More POVs as story expands, fewer as it focuses

### Reader Attachment

**Problem**: More POVs = diluted emotional investment

**Solutions**:
- Open and close with primary POV
- Return to primary regularly
- Give each POV distinct stakes
- Make POV switches earn their place

## Prose Anti-Patterns

### Purple Prose
Overwritten, self-conscious, draws attention to style:
> The luminescent orb of celestial fire descended beyond the horizon's edge, painting the firmament in a glorious symphony of crimson and gold.

**Fix**: Clear, invisible prose. Let story shine, not words.

### Beige Prose
Too plain, no voice, mechanical:
> The sun set. It was orange. She looked at it. Then she went inside.

**Fix**: Add voice, vary rhythm, choose meaningful details.

### Adverb Overuse
> "I hate you," she said angrily, slamming her fist loudly on the table dramatically.

**Fix**: Strong verbs and action beats. Cut most adverbs.

### Filter Words
> She saw the car approaching. She heard the engine. She felt afraid.

**Fix**: The car approached. The engine growled. Her stomach dropped.

### Clichés
Dead metaphors, stock phrases, predictable descriptions.

**Fix**: Fresh, specific language. If you've read it before, revise.

## Voice

The author's fingerprint. Difficult to teach, emerges from all choices.

### Voice Elements

- Word choice (Latinate vs. Anglo-Saxon, formal vs. casual)
- Sentence structure (complex vs. simple, periodic vs. loose)
- Rhythm and pacing
- Tone (ironic, earnest, distant, intimate)
- What the narrator notices and ignores
- Metaphor patterns

### Developing Voice

1. Read widely, notice what you love
2. Write a lot, find natural patterns
3. Read your work aloud
4. Imitate writers you admire (then find your own way)
5. Trust instincts over rules

## Prose Rhythm Techniques

**Lists of three**: Satisfying rhythm (veni, vidi, vici)
**Parallel structure**: Creates emphasis through repetition
**Sentence inversion**: For occasional emphasis, invert you can
**Periodic sentences**: Delay the main point until the end, building suspense, adding detail, before finally, dramatically, revealing the key information.
**Asyndeton**: No conjunctions, faster rhythm, more urgent
**Polysyndeton**: And this and that and another, accumulating weight

## Editing for Style

### First Pass: Clarity
- Is meaning clear?
- Are sentences parseable?
- Any ambiguous pronouns?

### Second Pass: Economy
- Cut unnecessary words
- Eliminate redundancy
- Tighten phrases

### Third Pass: Rhythm
- Read aloud
- Vary sentence length
- Check paragraph flow

### Fourth Pass: Voice
- Consistent tone?
- Fresh language?
- Character-appropriate vocabulary?
