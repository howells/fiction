# Dialogue

Writing natural, purposeful dialogue.

## Dialogue Must Do Work

Every exchange should accomplish at least one:
- Reveal character (voice, values, relationships)
- Advance plot (new information, decisions)
- Create conflict (disagreement, tension, subtext)
- Establish tone (genre, mood)

**If dialogue does none of these, cut it.**

## Subtext

What characters mean but don't say directly.

### Creating Subtext

**Misdirection**: Character says opposite of what they mean
> "No, it's fine. I don't mind at all." [Clearly minds]

**Indirection**: Character talks around the real subject
> "So how's work?" [Actually asking: Are you still seeing her?]

**Deflection**: Character avoids the question
> "Did you take it?" "Do you remember that time we went to the lake?"

**Non-answer answers**: Response doesn't address what was asked
> "Can I trust you?" "I'm here, aren't I?"

### Subtext Techniques

- Characters rarely say what they really want
- Arguments are often about something other than stated topic
- What's NOT said is often more important than what is
- Physical action can contradict spoken words

## Dialogue Tags

### The "Said" Rule

**Use "said" (and "asked") 90% of the time.** It's invisible to readers.

**Avoid:**
- Said-bookisms: grumbled, exclaimed, opined, queried
- Adverb tags: said angrily, asked nervously
- Impossible tags: "Get out," she hissed. (No sibilants)

**Exception tags (use sparingly):**
- whispered, shouted (volume information)
- replied, answered (when "said" is awkward)

### Action Beats vs. Tags

Replace some tags with action:
> "I don't believe you." Sarah crossed her arms.

**Benefits of action beats:**
- Show character's physical state
- Ground dialogue in scene
- Vary rhythm
- Convey emotion without adverbs

### Tag Placement

- **Before dialogue**: Rare, creates anticipation
- **After dialogue**: Standard, unobtrusive
- **Mid-dialogue**: Creates pause, emphasizes what follows

> "I know," he said, "but that doesn't change anything."

## Formatting Conventions

- New speaker = new paragraph
- Actions by speaker go in same paragraph as their dialogue
- Long speeches can break across paragraphs (no close quote until final paragraph)
- Internal thought: italics or unmarked (consistent within work)

## Natural Dialogue

### What Real Speech Does

- Interrupts
- Trails off...
- Uses contractions
- Uses incomplete sentences
- Includes filler (um, well, you know)—but use sparingly
- Responds imprecisely to questions

### Dialogue Should NOT

- Be perfectly grammatical
- Answer questions directly (usually)
- Use full names ("Hello, John Smith, my brother")
- Explain things characters both know ("As you know, Bob...")
- Deliver long speeches without interruption

## "As You Know, Bob"

The exposition dump disguised as dialogue.

**Bad:**
> "As you know, Bob, our company was founded in 1985 by your father..."

**Better options:**
- Character genuinely doesn't know (newcomer, outsider)
- Conflict over the information
- Reveal through implication and reaction
- Just narrate it

## Dialogue Rhythm

**Vary length**: Mix long exchanges with single words
**Use silence**: "..." or "She didn't respond"
**Interruptions**: Em dash— for cut off, ellipsis... for trailing
**Overlapping**: "But—" / "I don't want to hear it."

### Tension in Dialogue

- Short sentences increase pace
- Questions without answers create uncertainty
- Delayed responses suggest concealment
- Topic changes suggest avoidance
- Repetition emphasizes (and can annoy)

## Distinctive Voice in Dialogue

Each character should have recognizable speech patterns:

| Element | Variations |
|---------|------------|
| Vocabulary | Educated/simple, formal/casual, jargon |
| Sentence length | Terse/verbose, fragments/complete |
| Directness | Blunt/circumspect, confrontational/diplomatic |
| Rhythm | Flowing/staccato, measured/impulsive |
| Quirks | Catchphrases, verbal tics, patterns |

## Common Dialogue Problems

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| All characters sound same | Differentiate vocabulary, syntax, topics |
| Too much small talk | Enter conversation late, leave early |
| On-the-nose dialogue | Add subtext, characters don't say what they mean |
| Info dumps | Break up, add conflict, show instead |
| Floating dialogue | Add action beats, ground in setting |
| Monotonous rhythm | Vary sentence length and beat placement |
