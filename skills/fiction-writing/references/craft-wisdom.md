## The Writing Process

### First Drafts Are Meant to Be Bad

The first draft is exploratory. It's where you discover what you're writing about. Don't judge it, don't polish it, don't show it to anyone. Let it be messy. You'll fix it in revision.

Write the first draft with the door closed. It's just for you.

### Take It Bird by Bird

When overwhelmed by the scope of a project, focus on the smallest manageable piece. Just the next scene. Just the next paragraph. The whole novel is too big to hold in your mind—but you can write one scene.

Break the impossible into the possible.

### Write Regularly at the Same Time

Train your unconscious to show up. Sit down at the same time each day. Your creative mind will learn when it's expected to work.

Waiting for inspiration is amateur behavior. Professionals show up.

### Read Constantly

Reading is how you internalize craft. Read in your genre. Read outside your genre. Read good writing to absorb what works. Read bad writing to understand what doesn't.

The best writers are voracious readers.

## The Truth About Writing

### Writing Is Telepathy

A writer sits alone and puts thoughts into words. Years later, miles away, a reader sits alone and receives those thoughts. The writer's images appear in the reader's mind.

This is magic. Treat it with respect.

### Tell the Truth

Good writing is about telling the truth—emotional truth, observed truth, the truth of how things feel. Don't try to sound like someone else. Write what you actually think and see and feel.

Risk being unliked. Safe writing is boring writing.

### The Ideal Reader

Write for one specific person—your ideal reader. Someone who will understand, who will get the jokes, who will feel the emotional beats. When you're stuck, ask: "What would they want to happen here?"

This imaginary reader keeps you honest and prevents you from disappearing up your own cleverness.

## Craft Principles

### Kill Your Darlings

That beautiful sentence you're so proud of? If it doesn't serve the story, cut it. Don't let your ego damage the work.

But don't kill darlings too early. Fix structure first. The second draft is for structural killing—scenes that don't work, subplots that go nowhere. Prose-level darlings wait until the story is sound.

### Avoid Weak Writing

- **Passive voice** is weak. "The door was opened by John" vs. "John opened the door."
- **Adverbs** often signal weak verbs. "She ran quickly" vs. "She sprinted."
- **Explaining emotions** is weaker than showing them. Don't tell readers how to feel.

Strong verbs. Active voice. Concrete details.

### Rewrite with the Door Open

The second draft is for your reader. Now you ask: Does this make sense? Is this clear? Where did I lose myself?

Listen to feedback about what confused people. You don't have to take every suggestion, but you need to hear where readers struggled.

## The Writer's Mind

### Silence the Inner Critic

The critical voice that says you're no good, that this is stupid, that you should give up—it's lying. Acknowledge it, set it aside, and keep writing.

The critic has no place in the first draft. It can visit during revision.

### Fill the Well

When you're empty, don't force it. Go live. Read. Walk. Have conversations. Collect experiences. You can't write from an empty well.

Writing requires input as well as output.

### Let Emotions Fuel the Work

Strong feelings make strong writing. Write from joy, anger, sadness, curiosity, despair. The emotional truth of your experience is what makes fiction resonate.

Don't write what you think you should feel. Write what you actually feel.

## Why We Write

### Writing Is Connection

Writing and reading decrease our sense of isolation. They deepen and widen our sense of life. When a reader recognizes their own experience in your words, neither of you is alone anymore.

### It's Not About Fame

Writing isn't about money, recognition, or validation. It's about the work itself. It's about enriching your readers' lives and your own.

If you need external rewards to write, you'll quit. Write because you must.

## Summary: The Core Rules

1. **Show up every day** — same time, same place
2. **Write badly first** — you can fix it later
3. **Tell the truth** — emotional honesty above all
4. **Read constantly** — input feeds output
5. **Kill your darlings** — serve the story, not your ego
6. **Take it bird by bird** — one scene at a time
7. **Write for one reader** — not an audience, a person
8. **Silence the critic** — during drafting, not revision
9. **Strong verbs, active voice** — weak writing is passive
10. **Write because you must** — not for external rewards
