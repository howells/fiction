# Pacing

Controlling narrative speed and tension.

## What is Pacing?

The reader's perception of speed. Not about word count—about perceived time and tension.

## Scene/Sequel Balance

The primary pacing lever (see scene-structure.md for full detail).

| Pacing Goal | Scene/Sequel Ratio |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Breakneck (thriller, action) | 90% Scene, 10% Sequel |
| Fast | 70% Scene, 30% Sequel |
| Balanced | 50/50 |
| Contemplative (literary) | 40% Scene, 60% Sequel |
| Very slow | 30% Scene, 70% Sequel |

**Adjust within story**: Opening may be slow (setup), middle increases pace, climax fastest, denouement slows again.

## Sentence-Level Pacing

### Fast Pacing

Short sentences. Fragments. Quick paragraphs.
- White space on page
- Action verbs
- Cut description
- Minimal introspection
- Dialogue dominates

### Slow Pacing

Longer sentences allow the reader to settle in, to absorb details, to feel the weight of moments as they unfold.
- Dense paragraphs
- Sensory detail
- Interior thought
- Description and reflection
- Narration dominates

## Compression and Expansion

### Time Compression

Summarize periods where little story-relevant happens:
> Three days passed in a blur of planning and sleepless nights.

### Time Expansion

Slow down crucial moments. A single second can take paragraphs:
> The gun rose. His finger whitened on the trigger. She watched the barrel track across the room toward her, slow as a nightmare, and in that suspended moment she saw everything—

**Rule**: Expand what matters, compress what doesn't.

## Tension Techniques

### Micro-Tension

Line-by-line tension through:
- Unanswered questions
- Conflict in every exchange
- Subtext beneath surface meaning
- Characters wanting different things
- Unresolved implications

**Donald Maass principle**: Every page should have something unresolved.

### Macro-Tension

Story-level tension through:
- Stakes that matter
- Ticking clocks
- Escalating obstacles
- Incomplete information
- Promises that haven't paid off

## Tension Killers

| Killer | Why It Deflates | Fix |
|--------|-----------------|-----|
| **Explaining too much** | Removes mystery | Trust reader to infer |
| **Resolving too soon** | No lingering suspense | Delay gratification |
| **Backstory dumps** | Stops forward momentum | Weave in, don't dump |
| **Pleasant conversations** | No conflict = no tension | Add opposing wants |
| **Repetitive beats** | Predictable = boring | Vary dynamics |
| **Low stakes** | Nothing to lose | Raise consequences |

## Chapter and Scene Breaks

### Ending Chapters/Scenes

**Strong endings:**
- Question raised, unanswered
- Reversal or revelation
- Disaster (Scene structure)
- Decision that commits character
- Cliffhanger (use judiciously)

**Weak endings:**
- Character falling asleep
- Scene fading out
- Problem resolved (no hook to continue)
- Summary of what just happened

### Strategic Breaks

- Cut at peak tension, resume after gap
- Use breaks to compress time
- Parallel scenes (cut between storylines)
- End chapter on POV character's fear, start next with confirmation

## White Space and Formatting

Visual pacing signals:
- Shorter paragraphs = faster perceived pace
- More dialogue = faster pace
- Section breaks = time jumps, perspective shifts
- One-sentence paragraphs = emphasis, punch

## Genre Pacing Expectations

| Genre | Typical Pacing |
|-------|----------------|
| Thriller | Fast, relentless, minimal reflection |
| Mystery | Moderate, allows deduction time |
| Literary | Variable, often slower, contemplative |
| Romance | Balanced, emotional beats matter |
| Action | Very fast, constant motion |
| Horror | Variable, tension-and-release cycles |
| Fantasy | Often slower in setup, varies widely |

## Diagnostic: Is Pacing Off?

**Too fast:**
- Emotional beats land flat
- Reader doesn't care about characters
- Important moments feel rushed
- No breathing room

**Too slow:**
- Reader skimming paragraphs
- "Get on with it" feeling
- Scenes without conflict
- Excessive introspection

## Pacing Fixes

**Speed up:**
- Cut description
- Convert narration to dialogue
- Remove filter words and introspection
- Shorten sentences
- Remove scenes that don't advance plot
- Enter later, leave earlier

**Slow down:**
- Add sensory detail
- Expand emotional reactions
- Include character thought
- Add tension-building obstacles
- Let important moments breathe
- Use longer, flowing sentences
