# Shared Style Rules

Rules that both The Chicago Manual of Style and the New Oxford Style Manual agree on. Apply these regardless of which guide the project follows.

## Grammar

### Agreement
- Subject-verb agreement: "The group of soldiers **was** advancing" (collective noun, singular in American; either in British — but consistency matters)
- Pronoun-antecedent agreement: "Everyone took **their** seat" is now accepted by both guides
- Maintain parallel structure in lists and comparisons

### Modifiers
- Fix dangling modifiers: "Walking to school, **the rain started**" → "Walking to school, **she got caught in the rain**"
- Fix misplaced modifiers: "She almost ate **the whole cake**" vs "She ate **almost the whole cake**"
- "Only" should be placed directly before the word it modifies

### Tense
- Maintain tense consistency within passages
- Tense shifts for flashback/memory are acceptable if clearly signalled
- Past perfect ("had gone") should be used to establish a flashback, then can shift to simple past

### Sentence Structure
- Split infinitives are acceptable when they sound natural: "to boldly go" is fine
- Sentence fragments are acceptable in fiction for rhythm and effect
- Ending sentences with prepositions is acceptable in modern prose
- Starting sentences with "And," "But," or "Because" is acceptable in fiction

### Common Errors (Always Fix)
- Its (possessive) vs it's (it is)
- Their/there/they're
- Who (subject) vs whom (object) — though "whom" is increasingly rare in fiction dialogue
- Lay (transitive, takes an object) vs lie (intransitive)
- Affect (verb) vs effect (noun, usually)
- Fewer (countable) vs less (uncountable)
- Farther (physical distance) vs further (figurative)
- Ensure (make certain) vs insure (insurance)

## Punctuation — Shared Rules

### Semicolons
- Join two closely related independent clauses: "She left; he stayed"
- Separate items in a list when items contain commas
- Do not use before "and" or "but" (use comma instead)
- Place outside closing quotation marks

### Colons
- Introduce a list, explanation, or amplification
- The clause before the colon should be a complete sentence
- Place outside closing quotation marks

### Apostrophes
- Possessive singular: add 's (the dog's bone)
- Possessive plural: add ' after existing s (the dogs' bones)
- Possessive of names ending in s: add 's (James's, Charles's) — both guides prefer this
- No apostrophe for possessive pronouns (its, hers, theirs, yours)
- No apostrophe for decade plurals: 1990s, not 1990's

### Hyphens
- Compound adjectives before a noun: "well-known author," "three-year-old child"
- No hyphen after -ly adverbs: "newly published book" (not "newly-published")
- No hyphen when compound comes after the noun: "the author was well known"
- Prefixes: generally no hyphen (rewrite, prewar, coexist) but hyphenate for clarity (re-cover vs recover, co-op)

### Exclamation Marks
- Use sparingly in narrative prose
- One is enough — never use multiples (!!)
- Avoid in dialogue tags when "said" would suffice

### Question Marks
- Inside quotes if the question is part of the quoted material
- Outside quotes if the surrounding sentence is the question

### Parentheses
- Punctuation goes outside if the parenthetical is within a sentence
- Punctuation goes inside if the entire sentence is parenthetical

## Italics

Both guides agree on these uses:
- **Titles of long works:** books, films, albums, TV series, newspapers, paintings
- **Titles NOT italicised:** short stories, poems, songs, episodes (use quotation marks)
- **Foreign words:** on first use in the text; familiar words (café, résumé, cliché) need not be italicised
- **Emphasis:** sparingly, and less is more
- **Internal thought:** if the convention is established (not all fiction uses this)
- **Letters as letters:** "the letter *p*"
- **Ship names:** *HMS Victory*, *Titanic*
- **Sound effects in narrative:** *bang*, *whoosh* (optional, both guides permit this)

## Numbers in Fiction

### Spell Out
- Numbers expressible in one or two words: one, twelve, ninety-nine, one hundred, three thousand
- Any number that begins a sentence (or rephrase)
- Round numbers: two hundred, fifty thousand
- Centuries: the nineteenth century
- Time in narrative: "half past three," "ten o'clock"
- Approximations: "about fifty people"

### Use Numerals
- Specific large numbers when precision matters: 1,247 soldiers
- Addresses: 221B Baker Street
- Dates within the text (format varies by guide — see guide-specific files)
- Percentages (word vs symbol varies by guide)
- Exact measurements when precision matters: 6 feet 2 inches

### Consistency
- Within a passage, be consistent: don't mix "twelve soldiers and 8 horses"
- Same category of number should use same treatment

## Dialogue Mechanics

### Attribution
- "Said" and "asked" are invisible — prefer them overwhelmingly
- Avoid said bookisms: "ejaculated," "opined," "queried"
- Action beats can replace tags: 'She picked up the glass. "I don't believe you."'
- Don't attribute every line — in two-person dialogue, alternation makes it clear

### Interrupted Speech
- Em-dash at the point of interruption: "I was going to—"
- Self-interruption (trailing off): ellipsis. "I thought maybe..."

### Dialogue Paragraphing
- New speaker = new paragraph (always)
- Long speech by one speaker: open quotes at start of each paragraph, closing quotes only at the end of the final paragraph
- Actions by the speaker can be in the same paragraph as their dialogue

### Internal Thought
Both guides recognise these conventions (choose one and be consistent):
- Italics without tags: *I should never have come here.*
- Italics with tags: *I should never have come here,* she thought.
- No italics, integrated into narrative: She thought she should never have come here.

## Possessives — Special Cases

Both guides agree:
- Singular possessive of names ending in s: **James's**, **Charles's**, **Dickens's**
- Exception: ancient/classical names are often just apostrophe: Jesus', Moses', Socrates'
- Joint possession: "Jack and Jill's bucket" (one bucket, shared)
- Separate possession: "Jack's and Jill's buckets" (each has their own)

## Lists in Prose

- Short, simple lists can run into the sentence
- Longer or complex lists may be formatted as bullet points (rare in fiction narrative, common in nonfiction)
- Be consistent with punctuation within lists

## Abbreviations in Fiction

- Spell out in narrative prose: "mister" not "Mr" (unless the formality is intentional)
- Common abbreviations in dialogue are fine: "Mr," "Mrs," "Dr"
- Do not use "etc." in narrative — rephrase
- Spell out "United States" in narrative; "US" or "U.S." acceptable in dialogue
- Spell out units in narrative: "miles," "pounds," "kilograms"

## Capitalisation — Shared Rules

- Proper nouns: names, specific places, nationalities
- Titles before names: President Lincoln, Queen Elizabeth
- Generic titles after names or without names: the president, the queen (capitalisation varies — see guide-specific files)
- Seasons: lowercase (spring, summer, autumn/fall, winter)
- Directions as regions: capitalise (the South, the West); as compass directions: lowercase (head south)
- Historical periods/events: capitalise (the Renaissance, the Second World War)
- Deities: capitalise (God, Allah) but lowercase generic uses (the gods, a prayer to god)
