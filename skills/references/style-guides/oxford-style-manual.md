# New Oxford Style Manual — Fiction Rules

Rules specific to British English fiction following NOSM (including New Hart's Rules). Load this alongside `shared-rules.md` for British manuscripts.

## Punctuation

### Serial (Oxford) Comma
**Oxford recommends it** — despite what many assume:
- "Red, white, and blue" (the Oxford comma IS the Oxford comma)
- Use when it resolves ambiguity: "my parents, the Queen, and the President"
- May be omitted in simple, unambiguous lists where house style prefers it — but when in doubt, include it

### Dashes — En-Dash (Preferred) or Em-Dash (Spaced)
Oxford style prefers the **spaced en-dash** for parenthetical interruptions:
- "She left – without a word – and never came back."

Alternatively, some British publishers use a **spaced em-dash**:
- "She left — without a word — and never came back."

**Never use a closed (unspaced) em-dash in Oxford style.**

Check the manuscript's established convention and enforce consistency. If no convention is established, default to spaced en-dash.

### Dialogue Quotation Marks
**Single quotes primary, double for nesting:**
- 'I heard him say, "Leave me alone," and then he left.'
- Alternate for deeper nesting: 'She said, "He told me, 'Go away,' and I did."'

**Important:** Many British publishers now use double quotes. If the manuscript uses doubles consistently, that is acceptable — enforce consistency, not a switch.

### Comma and Period Placement — Logical Quoting
**Logical placement** — punctuation goes inside quotes only if it was part of the original quoted material:

In dialogue (where punctuation IS part of the speech):
- 'Hello,' she said. (comma inside — it's part of the speech act)
- 'Are you coming?' he asked. (question mark inside — it's her question)

In non-dialogue references (where punctuation is NOT part of the quote):
- The sign read 'No Entry'. (period outside — the period is the narrative sentence's, not the sign's)
- He called it 'a disaster'. (period outside)
- She described it as 'unbelievable', but he disagreed. (comma outside)

**The key distinction:** In dialogue attribution, commas and periods go inside (same as American). In all other quotation, apply logic — does the punctuation belong to the quote or the sentence?

### Semicolons and Colons
**Always outside closing quotation marks** (same as American):
- She called it 'a disaster'; he disagreed.

### Question Marks and Exclamation Points
- Inside if part of the quoted material: 'Are you coming?'
- Outside if the surrounding sentence is the question: Did she really say 'I'm fine'?

### Ellipsis
**Three dots, no spaces between them (… or ...):**
- Trailing off: 'I thought maybe...'
- Oxford prefers no space before the ellipsis when it follows a word
- Space after the ellipsis if the sentence continues: 'I thought... but no.'
- **No four-dot convention** — unlike CMOS, Oxford does not use a period + ellipsis

### Commas
- After introductory phrases: 'After the rain, she went outside.'
- In compound sentences before conjunction: 'She ran, and he followed.'
- That/which distinction is **less rigid** in British English — both "the book that" and "the book which" can be used restrictively. But non-restrictive clauses still take commas: 'The book, which was long, sat on the shelf.'
- No comma before 'too' at end of sentence is the norm: 'I like it too.'

## Spelling — Oxford English (Important Distinction)

Oxford spelling is NOT Cambridge spelling. Oxford University Press uses **-ize** spellings where etymologically justified. This is the key difference from most other British publishers.

### The -ize / -ise Split
Oxford prefers **-ize** where the suffix derives from Greek -izo:
- realize, organize, recognize, memorize, capitalize, characterize

Words that are ALWAYS -ise (not from Greek -izo):
- advertise, advise, compromise, devise, exercise, improvise, supervise, surprise, revise, televise, franchise, merchandise

**This is the single most distinctive feature of Oxford spelling.** If the project follows Oxford style, use -ize. If it follows general British convention (Cambridge, most UK publishers), use -ise throughout.

### Noun Endings
- -our: colour, honour, favour, humour, labour, neighbour, vigour
- -re: centre, theatre, fibre, sabre, sombre, metre (measurement AND poetry)
- -ogue: dialogue, catalogue, analogue, prologue (never -og)
- -ence: defence, offence, licence (noun), pretence
- -ement: judgement (not judgment), acknowledgement (not acknowledgment)

### Verb Forms
- Double l before suffix: travelled, cancelled, modelled, labelled, signalled, levelled
  - This applies even when the stress is not on the final syllable
- Both -ed and -t past tense are acceptable: learned/learnt, burned/burnt, spelled/spelt, dreamed/dreamt
  - -t forms are more common in British English and often sound more natural
  - Be consistent within the manuscript

### Directional Words
- Trailing s: towards, afterwards, forwards, backwards, upwards, downwards

### Specific Words
| British | Not |
|---------|-----|
| grey | gray |
| whilst (acceptable) | — (while is also fine) |
| amongst (acceptable) | — (among is also fine) |
| amid/amidst | — (both acceptable) |
| tyre | tire (on a car) |
| kerb | curb (pavement edge) |
| plough | plow |
| doughnut | donut |
| aeroplane | airplane |
| aluminium | aluminum |
| sceptic | skeptic |
| pyjamas | pajamas |
| manoeuvre | maneuver |
| cheque (money) | check |
| practise (verb) | practice (verb) |
| practice (noun) | practise (noun) |
| licence (noun) | license (noun) |
| license (verb) | licence (verb) |

### Practice/Practise and Licence/License
This is a common error point. The rule:
- **Noun = c** (practice, licence) — think "advice" (noun)
- **Verb = s** (practise, license) — think "advise" (verb)

## Dates and Time

### Dates in Narrative
- Day Month Year: '15 March 2024' (no comma, no ordinal)
- Ordinals acceptable in running text: 'the fifteenth of March'
- Day of week: 'Tuesday 15 March' (no comma)
- Decades: the 1990s, the nineties
- Centuries: the nineteenth century (hyphenated as adjective: nineteenth-century technology)

### Time
- Spell out in narrative: 'half past three,' 'ten o'clock,' 'quarter to five'
- Use numerals with periods or colons: '3.30 p.m.' or '3:30 p.m.'
  - Oxford accepts both but the dot (3.30) is more traditionally British
- The 24-hour clock is acceptable in some contexts: '15.30'
- Noon and midnight: use the words

## Numbers

- Per cent: 'per cent' (two words) — though 'percent' is increasingly accepted
  - 'Fifty per cent of the vote'
  - Use % only in technical/scientific contexts
- Money: spell out for simple amounts ('five pounds'), numerals for precise amounts ('£5.75')
  - Note: £ before the number, 'p' after for pence: '50p'
- Phone numbers: 020 7123 4567 (grouped), +44 20 7123 4567 (international)

## Capitalisation — British Conventions

British English generally capitalises less than American:
- Titles: lowercase unless directly before a name
  - 'the prime minister spoke' but 'Prime Minister Blair spoke'
  - 'the queen arrived' but 'Queen Elizabeth arrived'
  - 'the archbishop' but 'Archbishop Williams'
- Government: lowercase generic references
  - 'the government announced' (not 'the Government')
  - 'parliament debated' (not 'Parliament' — unless referring to a specific parliament by name)
  - But: 'the House of Commons,' 'the Cabinet' (specific bodies)
- Regions: the south of England, the north (lowercase for British regions — unlike American convention)
  - But: the South-East (hyphenated region names can be capitalised)
  - And: the Middle East, the Far East (established proper nouns)
- Wars: the first world war, the second world war (Oxford lowercases — though 'the Second World War' is also acceptable)
- Seasons: lowercase (spring, summer, autumn, winter)
- 'Autumn' not 'fall' (though 'fall' is understood)

## Formatting Conventions

### Scene Breaks
- Blank line, or three spaced asterisks (* * *), or typographic ornament
- Be consistent throughout

### Emphasis in Narrative
- Italics for emphasis (same as American — never bold, rarely ALL CAPS)

### Thoughts
- Italics for direct internal thought: *I need to get out of here.*
- No quotation marks around thoughts

### Letters, Texts, Signs
- Similar conventions to American — be consistent

### Chapter Titles
- Sentence case is more common in British publishing: 'The man who wasn't there'
  - But title case is also acceptable — follow the manuscript's convention

## Compound Words

Oxford style aligns with CMOS on most hyphenation rules, but:
- British English tends to hyphenate more compound words than American
- 'To-day' and 'to-morrow' are archaic — modern British uses 'today,' 'tomorrow'
- 'Co-operate' (hyphenated) is traditional Oxford, though 'cooperate' is gaining ground
- 'Email' (no hyphen) is now standard in both
- Age terms: 'a five-year-old' (noun); 'a five-year-old child' (adjective) — same as American

## Vocabulary in Narrative vs Dialogue

When editing a British manuscript with characters who speak in American English (or vice versa), the rule is:
- **Narrative** follows the project's declared style guide
- **Dialogue** follows the character's natural speech patterns
- Flag but do not auto-correct vocabulary differences in dialogue that reflect character voice
- Example: An American character in a British novel would say 'apartment,' not 'flat' — that's correct, not an error
