# The Chicago Manual of Style — Fiction Rules

Rules specific to American English fiction following CMOS. Load this alongside `shared-rules.md` for American manuscripts.

## Punctuation

### Serial (Oxford) Comma
**Always use it.** CMOS is unambiguous:
- "Red, white, and blue" (not "red, white and blue")
- Applies in all lists, no exceptions

### Em-Dash
**Closed — no spaces:**
- "She left—without a word—and never came back."
- No spaces on either side of the em-dash
- Used for interruption, parenthetical, and amplification
- Two em-dashes for missing letters in a word: "Mr. D——"
- Three em-dashes for an entirely missing word: "——— was there."

### En-Dash
- Number ranges: pages 10–25, 1939–1945
- Compound adjectives where one element is multi-word: "New York–based," "post–World War II"
- Do NOT use en-dashes as parenthetical dashes (use em-dashes)

### Dialogue Quotation Marks
**Double quotes primary, single quotes for nesting:**
- "I heard him say, 'Leave me alone,' and then he left."
- Alternate for deeper nesting: "She said, 'He told me, "Go away," and I did.'"

### Comma and Period Placement
**Always inside closing quotation marks** — regardless of logic:
- "Hello," she said. (comma inside)
- She whispered "hello." (period inside)
- He called it "a disaster." (period inside, even though it's not part of the quote)
- The sign read "No Entry." (period inside)

### Semicolons and Colons
**Always outside closing quotation marks:**
- She called it "a disaster"; he disagreed.
- Three things about "the plan": cost, timing, and risk.

### Question Marks and Exclamation Points
- Inside if part of the quoted material: "Are you coming?"
- Outside if the surrounding sentence is the question: Did she really say "I'm fine"?

### Ellipsis
CMOS technically specifies three spaced dots (. . .) but **most American fiction publishers use the single character (…)**. Be consistent with whichever the manuscript uses.

- Trailing off in dialogue: "I thought maybe…"
- Omission in quoted material: "She said… nothing useful."
- No ellipsis at the start of a quote (just begin the quote)
- **Four dots** when a sentence ends and the ellipsis follows: "She waited…. Then she left." (period + ellipsis, or ellipsis + period — CMOS allows both)

### Commas
- After introductory phrases: "After the rain, she went outside."
- Before "too" at end of sentence: optional in CMOS. "I like it, too" or "I like it too" — be consistent
- In compound sentences before conjunction: "She ran, and he followed." (Use comma before and/but/or joining two independent clauses)
- No comma before "that" in restrictive clauses: "The book that she read was long."
- Comma before "which" in non-restrictive clauses: "The book, which was long, sat on the shelf."

## Spelling — American English

### Verb Endings
- -ize (not -ise): realize, organize, recognize, memorize, capitalize
- Exception: advertise, advise, compromise, exercise, improvise, supervise, surprise (always -ise)

### Noun Endings
- -or (not -our): color, honor, favor, humor, labor, neighbor, vigor
- -er (not -re): center, theater, fiber, saber, somber, meter (measurement)
  - Exception: "metre" in poetry (the rhythmic term) vs "meter" (measurement device)
- -og (not -ogue): catalog, dialog, analog
  - Exception: "dialogue" is preferred in American fiction (CMOS notes both are acceptable but dialogue dominates)
- -ense (not -ence): defense, offense, license, pretense
- -ment: judgment (not judgement), acknowledgment (not acknowledgement)

### Verb Forms
- Single l before suffix: traveled, canceled, modeled, labeled, signaled, leveled
  - Exception: words where the stress falls on the final syllable: compelling, controlling, excelling
- -ed past tense where British uses -t: learned (not learnt), burned (not burnt), spelled (not spelt), dreamed (not dreamt)
  - Both "leaped/leapt" are acceptable in American English

### Directional Words
- No trailing s: toward, afterward, forward, backward, upward, downward

### Specific Words
| American | Not |
|----------|-----|
| gray | grey |
| while | whilst |
| among | amongst |
| amid | amidst |
| tire (on a car) | tyre |
| curb | kerb |
| plow | plough |
| donut (informal) | doughnut |
| airplane | aeroplane |
| aluminum | aluminium |
| skeptic | sceptic |
| pajamas | pyjamas |
| maneuver | manoeuvre |
| check (money) | cheque |

## Dates and Time

### Dates in Narrative
- Month Day, Year: "March 15, 2024"
- Comma after the year when the date is mid-sentence: "On March 15, 2024, she arrived."
- Day of week: "Tuesday, March 15"
- Decades: the 1990s, the nineties, the '90s (curly apostrophe)
- Centuries: the twenty-first century (hyphenated as adjective: twenty-first-century technology)

### Time
- Spell out in narrative: "half past three," "ten o'clock," "quarter to five"
- Use numerals with a.m./p.m.: "3:30 p.m." (with periods in a.m./p.m.)
- Noon and midnight: use the words, not "12:00"

## Numbers

- Percent: "percent" (one word, spelled out in narrative)
  - "Fifty percent of the vote"
  - Use % only in technical/scientific contexts
- Money: spell out for simple amounts ("five dollars"), numerals for precise amounts ("$5.75")
- Phone numbers: (555) 123-4567

## Capitalisation — American Conventions

- Titles: generally capitalise more than British
  - "the President" (when referring to a specific president, CMOS allows this)
  - "the Secretary of State"
  - But lowercase generic: "a president," "the senators"
- Government bodies: capitalise specific names (Congress, the Senate, the Supreme Court)
- Regions: the South, the Midwest, the West Coast, the East
- Wars: the Civil War, World War II

## Formatting Conventions

### Scene Breaks
- Typographic ornament or three centred asterisks (* * *) or blank line with hash (#)
- Be consistent throughout

### Emphasis in Narrative
- Italics for emphasis (never bold in fiction, never ALL CAPS except in extreme cases)
- Underline is a typesetting instruction, not used in finished prose

### Thoughts
- Italics for direct internal thought: *I need to get out of here.*
- No quotation marks around thoughts

### Letters, Texts, Signs
- Letters within fiction: typically italicised or set off
- Texts/messages: various conventions (italics, different font) — be consistent
- Signs: quotation marks or small caps: The sign read "KEEP OUT" or the sign read KEEP OUT

### Chapter Titles
- Title case: capitalise principal words

## Compound Words

CMOS maintains an extensive hyphenation guide. Key fiction-relevant rules:
- Compound adjectives before nouns: well-known author, three-year-old child
- Age terms: a five-year-old (noun); a five-year-old child (adjective)
- Fractions: two-thirds (adjective), two thirds (noun in some contexts)
- "Self-" compounds are always hyphenated: self-aware, self-destructive
- "Re-" words: no hyphen unless it creates confusion (re-cover vs recover, re-creation vs recreation)
