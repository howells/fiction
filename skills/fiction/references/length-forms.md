# Length Forms

Craft considerations by story length.

## Word Count Definitions

| Form | Word Count | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Flash Fiction | Under 1,000 | Sometimes 500, sometimes 1,500 |
| Short Story | 1,000–7,500 | Traditional magazine length |
| Novelette | 7,500–17,500 | Between short and novella |
| Novella | 17,500–40,000 | Complete narrative, compressed |
| Novel | 40,000–120,000 | Genre-dependent |
| Epic/Saga | 120,000+ | Often fantasy/sci-fi |

## Flash Fiction (Under 1,000 words)

### Characteristics
- Single moment, emotion, or revelation
- No room for subplot
- Every word must earn its place
- Often relies on implication
- Ending twist or resonance common

### Techniques
- In medias res (no setup room)
- Single POV, single scene
- Trust reader to fill gaps
- Surprising final line
- Title does work (can be part of story)

### What to Cut
- Backstory (imply instead)
- Setup (start in action)
- Transitions (one scene only)
- Description (minimal, evocative)

### Common Forms
- Sudden fiction (750 words)
- Drabble (exactly 100 words)
- Six-word story (exactly 6 words)
- Micro fiction (under 300 words)

## Short Story (1,000–7,500 words)

### Characteristics
- One central conflict
- Single protagonist (usually)
- Limited cast
- Tight timeframe (usually)
- Single effect or theme

### Structure Options
- **Classic**: Setup → Rising action → Climax → Brief resolution
- **Epiphany**: Character realization transforms understanding
- **Slice of life**: Moment captured, transformation implied
- **Twist**: Recontextualizes preceding events

### What Short Stories Do Well
- Explore single idea deeply
- Capture moment of change
- Experimental forms
- Voice-driven narrative
- Powerful ending resonance

### What Short Stories Can't Do
- Complex subplots
- Large casts
- Extended character development
- Epic scope
- Multiple POVs (usually)

### Common Mistake
Writing compressed novel instead of actual short story. Short stories aren't small novels—they're different form.

## Novella (17,500–40,000 words)

### Characteristics
- Complete narrative arc
- More complexity than short story
- Single main plot + possible light subplot
- Small cast (2-5 main characters)
- Often tight timeframe
- Deeper character development than short story

### Best Suited For
- Tight, focused narratives
- Romance (category length)
- Horror (sustained dread)
- Single relationship focus
- Extended exploration of one idea

### Structure
- Can use full three-act structure
- Often has abbreviated middle
- Less sprawl than novel
- Every scene must earn its place

### Publishing Considerations
- Harder to sell traditionally (awkward length)
- Thrives in digital/indie
- Popular in series format
- Category romance standard

## Novel (40,000–120,000 words)

### Genre Length Expectations

| Genre | Typical Range | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| Romance (category) | 50,000–70,000 | Tight, focused |
| Romance (single title) | 80,000–100,000 | More complex |
| Mystery | 70,000–90,000 | Procedural can run longer |
| Thriller | 80,000–100,000 | Fast-paced |
| Science Fiction | 90,000–120,000 | World-building needs space |
| Fantasy | 90,000–150,000+ | Epic can run very long |
| Literary | 70,000–100,000 | Variable |
| YA | 50,000–80,000 | Generally shorter |
| Middle Grade | 25,000–50,000 | Age-appropriate |

### Novel Capabilities
- Multiple subplots
- Large cast
- Deep character development
- Complex themes
- World-building
- Multiple POVs
- Extended timeline

### Debut Novel Considerations
- Shorter is safer (70,000–90,000)
- Agents/editors wary of very long debuts
- Genre expectations matter more than general rules

## Choosing Length

**Let story determine length.** Not the reverse.

| If your story needs... | Consider... |
|------------------------|-------------|
| Single moment/emotion | Flash fiction |
| One conflict, limited cast | Short story |
| Focused narrative, some complexity | Novella |
| Multiple arcs, full development | Novel |

### Warning Signs: Wrong Length

**Too short for story:**
- Characters underdeveloped
- Plot feels rushed
- Stakes not established
- Ending unearned

**Too long for story:**
- Padding obvious
- Subplots feel forced
- Repetitive scenes
- Slow middle

## Series Considerations

**Series types:**
- **Standalone**: Each book complete, shared world/characters
- **Serial**: Continuing story, books end on cliffhangers
- **Trilogy/Duology**: Planned arc across set number

**First-in-series requirements:**
- Must work as complete story
- Establish series potential
- Hook for continuing but satisfy for now
