# Openings

How to begin stories effectively.

## The Hook

First line, first paragraph, first page—each must compel continued reading.

### Hook Timing

| Level | Window | Must accomplish |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| First line | Instant | Intrigue, question, voice |
| First paragraph | 30 seconds | Promise of story |
| First page | 1-2 minutes | Character, situation, stakes |
| First chapter | 5-10 minutes | Full setup, first conflict |

### Hook Types

**Question/mystery**: Create curiosity
> The last time I saw my mother, she was on fire.

**In medias res**: Drop into action
> The knife was already in her hand when she heard the front door.

**Voice**: Compelling narrator
> If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born...

**Contradiction/surprise**: Unexpected juxtaposition
> It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.

**Statement of theme**: Declare what the story is about
> Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.

**Character in motion**: Protagonist doing something characteristic
> Katniss woke before dawn, slipped from the house, and headed for the woods.

## What Opening Must Establish

**Within first chapter:**
- [ ] Who is the protagonist?
- [ ] What do they want (at least initially)?
- [ ] What's their world like (briefly)?
- [ ] What's the tone/genre?
- [ ] Why should we care?

**Within first few chapters:**
- [ ] Central conflict/story question
- [ ] What's at stake?
- [ ] What's standing in the way?

## The "Contract" with Readers

Your opening promises what kind of story follows:
- Funny opening → comedic story
- Dark opening → darker story
- Action opening → action-driven plot
- Introspective opening → character-driven story

**Don't bait-and-switch.** Opening tone should match story tone.

## Common Opening Mistakes

### Starting Too Early

**Throat-clearing**: Backstory, setup, character waking up, traveling to where story starts.

**Fix**: Start as close to first conflict as possible. Cut until you hit something happening.

### Starting with Setup

**Info dump**: World-building, character descriptions, history lesson.

**Fix**: Trust reader. Reveal world through character action and perception.

### Starting Passively

**Things happen TO character**: Weather, setting, other people acting.

**Fix**: Protagonist doing something. Active verb in first sentence.

### Starting with Cliché

**Stock openings**:
- Waking up / alarm clock
- Looking in mirror (describing self)
- Dream sequence
- Weather report
- "Little did she know..."

**Fix**: Find the unexpected entry point.

## The First Line

### Qualities of Strong First Lines

- Creates question reader wants answered
- Establishes voice
- Contains energy/movement
- Surprising or unusual
- Specific, not generic

### First Line Techniques

**Paradox/contradiction**: Something unexpected
> The building was on fire, and it wasn't my fault.

**Immediate conflict**: Situation already tense
> When he woke, the dinosaur was still there.

**Bold claim**: Statement that demands elaboration
> I am an invisible man.

**Temporal marker**: Time is running out
> They say when you die, your life flashes before your eyes. They never mention it takes so long.

## The First Chapter

### Structural Options

**Prologue**: Use sparingly. Only if:
- Different time/POV from main story
- Essential information that can't be woven in
- Reader would be lost without it

**In medias res**: Jump into middle of action, fill in later

**Establishing normalcy**: Show ordinary world before disrupting it (common but risky—must be interesting)

**Frame story**: Begin at end, then tell how we got there

### First Chapter Ending

End first chapter with:
- Question reader must have answered
- First major plot point
- Reversal or revelation
- Character commitment to action
- Cliffhanger (use judiciously)

**NOT**: Resolution, sleep, fading out

## Opening Checklist

- [ ] Does first line create curiosity?
- [ ] Is protagonist active within first page?
- [ ] Is there conflict within first chapter?
- [ ] Do we know what protagonist wants?
- [ ] Is the tone appropriate to the story?
- [ ] Have I cut opening throat-clearing?
- [ ] Does it start as late as possible?
- [ ] Would I keep reading?

## Testing Your Opening

**The bookstore test**: Would a browser reading first page buy this?
**The friend test**: Can a cold reader tell you what the story is about after chapter one?
**The skip test**: Would cutting the first scene lose essential information?
