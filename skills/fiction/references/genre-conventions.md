# Genre Conventions

Reader expectations by genre.

## Why Genre Matters

Genres are promises. Readers choose genres expecting certain experiences. Fulfilling these expectations = satisfaction. Subverting them = either refreshing or frustrating.

**Know the rules before you break them.**

## Romance

### Required Elements
- Central love story (not subplot)
- Emotionally satisfying, optimistic ending (HEA or HFN)
- Both protagonists have POV (usually)
- Clear romantic conflict keeping them apart

### Structure
- Meet cute / inciting incident
- Growing attraction
- First kiss / intimacy (timing varies by heat level)
- Black moment (all seems lost)
- Grand gesture / reconciliation
- Commitment

### Expectations
- Pacing allows emotional development
- Sexual tension throughout
- Character growth through relationship
- Villain (if any) doesn't overshadow romance

### Heat Levels
- **Sweet/Clean**: Closed door, implied intimacy
- **Sensual**: Some love scenes, not explicit
- **Steamy**: Explicit scenes, important to story
- **Erotic**: Very explicit, sex central to plot

## Mystery

### Required Elements

- Clues planted fairly (reader can solve it)
- Resolution reveals solution
- Justice of some kind (even if bittersweet)

### Structure (Classic)

- Resolution and explanation

### Fair Play Rules
- All clues available to reader
- No information withheld from detective POV
- Solution logically follows from clues
- Criminal must appear early
- No supernatural solutions (unless genre blend)

### Subgenre Expectations
- **Cozy**: No graphic violence, amateur sleuth, community setting

- **Legal thriller**: Courtroom, attorney protagonist

## Thriller

### Required Elements
- High stakes (life, safety, security)
- Constant tension and danger
- Fast pacing

### Subgenre Notes

## Literary Fiction

### Characteristics
- Character and theme over plot
- Prose style foregrounded
- Ambiguity often embraced
- Internal conflict emphasized
- "Literary merit" valued

### Expectations
- Slower pacing acceptable
- Less conventional structure
- Open/ambiguous endings common
- Language itself matters
- Depth over entertainment (though not exclusive)

## Blending Genres

**Primary genre**: Sets core expectations (must fulfill these)
**Secondary genre**: Adds flavor (can subvert some conventions)

**Example**: Romantic suspense = Thriller conventions + Romance requirement (HEA)
**Example**: Urban fantasy = Fantasy world-building + Mystery structure

**Danger**: Disappointing both audiences by not fully committing to either.
