# Fiction Writing Craft

Reference guide for fiction writing techniques, story structure, and narrative craft.

## When to Use

**Use this skill when:**
- Writing or editing fiction prose (any length)
- Structuring a story, scene, or chapter
- Developing characters or their arcs
- Improving dialogue, pacing, or tension
- Diagnosing why a scene isn't working
- Choosing POV, tense, or narrative distance

**Don't use for:**
- Non-fiction, copywriting, or technical writing
- Poetry (different craft concerns)
- Screenwriting (use screenplay-specific resources)

## Core Principles

**1. Story = Character + Change**
Every story is about someone who wants something, faces obstacles, and is transformed by the struggle. Plot is what happens; story is what it means.

**2. Scene Economy**
Every scene must do at least two things: advance plot AND reveal character, or build world AND raise stakes. Scenes that do only one thing can usually be cut.

**3. Cause and Effect**
Events must feel inevitable in retrospect. "Because of X, Y happened" not "X happened, then Y happened." Coincidence can start a story but shouldn't resolve it.

**4. Specificity Creates Universality**
Concrete, specific details create emotional resonance. "A dog" is forgettable; "a three-legged beagle named Chester" lives in memory.

**5. Tension is Uncertainty**
Readers turn pages because they don't know what happens next. Create questions, delay answers, raise stakes before resolving them.

**6. Show Character Through Choice**
What characters DO under pressure reveals who they ARE. Action is character. Avoid telling us someone is brave—show them choosing courage when it costs them.

**7. Earned Moments**
Emotional payoffs require setup. Plant before you harvest. The bigger the moment, the more groundwork it needs.

## Decision Guides

### Choosing POV
- **First person**: Deep intimacy, unreliable narrator possible, limited knowledge
- **Third limited**: Balance of intimacy and flexibility, most common
- **Third omniscient**: God's-eye view, harder to create intimacy, good for epic scope
- **Second person**: Experimental, creates unusual reader involvement, rarely sustains novel length

### Choosing Tense
- **Past tense**: Traditional, invisible, readers expect it
- **Present tense**: Immediacy, urgency, can feel artificial if overused
- **Mix**: Generally avoid, but skilled writers break this rule

### When to Summarize vs. Scene
- **Scene**: Crucial moments, turning points, high emotion
- **Summary**: Routine events, transitions, compression of time
- **Rule**: If it matters, show it. If it's just logistics, tell it quickly.

## Common Diagnostic Questions

When a scene isn't working, ask:
1. What does the POV character want in THIS scene?
2. What's stopping them from getting it?
3. What changes by the end?
4. What question does this raise for the reader?
5. Can I cut the first paragraph? (Often yes)
6. Can I enter later and leave earlier?
