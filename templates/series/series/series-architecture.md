# Series Architecture

The complete series bible.

## Core Premise

[The series premise—what it's really about]

## Central Question

[What question does the series answer?]

## Series Arc

### Book 1: [Title]
[What happens. What's established. What question is raised.]

### Book 2: [Title]
[What happens. How it builds. Midpoint of series.]

### Book 3: [Title]
[What happens. How it resolves. The ending.]

## Major Revelations

| Revelation | When | Impact |
|------------|------|--------|
| [What's revealed] | Book X, Ch Y | [How it changes things] |

## Thematic Through-Lines

[What themes carry across all books]

## The Ending

[How does the series end? Be specific.]

## ⚓ Anchored

Items here are **immutable series constraints**. Individual books must conform to these—they cannot be overridden by story evolution. Use sparingly for truly foundational series elements.

[Examples: magic system rules, series ending, character identities, world history that cannot change]

1. [Constraint that must be preserved]
2. [Another constraint]

---

## Key Decisions

[Decisions that should be preserved but may evolve if the story demands. Unlike anchored items, these can be updated if the prose discovers something better.]

1. [Decision]
2. [Another decision]
